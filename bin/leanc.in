# Lean compiler
#
# A simple wrapper around C and C++ compilers. Defaults to the compiler Lean was built with,
# which can be overridden with the environment variables `LEAN_CC` and `LEAN_CXX`. All parameters are passed
# as-is to the wrapped compiler.
#
# Interesting options:
# * `-U LEAN_MULTI_THREAD` can be used to optimize programs not making use of multi-threading

set -e
bindir=$(dirname $0)

# As an optimization, we use a C compiler for compiling object files without linking.
# C files produced by Lean are also valid C++ files, but C compilers tend to be faster.
# Final linking still has to be done by a C++ compiler because we need to link against the
# Lean runtime written in C++ (https://isocpp.org/wiki/faq/mixing-c-and-cpp#overview-mixing-langs).
